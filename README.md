[http://quotes.toscrape.com/](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) is a demo website housing quotes from different authors. Attached to each quote is the author's name and related tags for searching for the quote.

Every page contains only 10 quotes, but there are multiple pages hosted on the site.

In this project, I run through each page on the site, collecting the following details from every quote on the site:
+ quote
+ author
+ tags

Finally, I save each detail as a row of data in a `.csv` file.
